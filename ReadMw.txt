To train yolo 
1) Download darknet : git clone https://github.com/AlexeyAB/darknet.git
2) In darknet fold go to makeflile change the value of GPU, CUDNN and OPENCV to 1
GPU = 1
CUDNN = 1
OPENCV = 1
3) Go to darknet project github download pretrained weight "yolov4.conv.137" place it in darknet fold
4) Download the weight for testing
5) copy yolov4.cfg from darknet/cfg to darknet and edit it
batch =64 (line 2)
subdivision=12 (line 3)
width=416 (line 8)
height=416 (line 9)
max_batches=2000(line 20)
steps=1600,1800 (line 22)

==== SEt FILTERS FOR CNN ====
filter = 18 (line 961)
classes=1 (line 968)

filter = 18 (line 1049)
classes=1 (line 1056)


filter = 18 (line 1137)
classes=1 (line 1144)

6) set covid_data fold and subfold image in darknet fold where we will put collected and anooted covid images
to pouulate the fold search on google coronavirus microscopic real images
7) Download LabelImg for image labeling "https://tzutalin.github.io/labelImg/ " in yolo4/custom_tools
